Marine Sound Identification using Long-Short Term Memory model

Acoustic signals are commonly used to study marine species due to the deep-sea environment's 
limited visibility. The advancements in underwater signal collection technology have resulted 
in a great number of acoustic data recordings that exceed the manual processing capabilities of 
a human, making the development of efficient marine mammal classification algorithms a key 
research area. This study presents an LSTM classification model trained on Mel Frequency 
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), type of features used in signal processing and speech 
recognition systems. Their importance analysis showed their very similar contribution to the 
model training and the LSTM algorithm demonstrated an average score of 86%. The 5-fold 
cross-validation approach was used to thoroughly evaluate the model's predictive accuracy and 
maintain a high level of performance consistency across multiple tests. In addition, the model 
has proved itself to perform better than Logistic Regression (67%), k-Nearest Neighbors (78%), 
and finally the Random Forest (83%), which almost matched the performance of the LSTM 
network.
